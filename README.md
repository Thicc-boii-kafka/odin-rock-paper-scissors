# odin-rock-paper-scissors
 This is a project on The Odin Project where we use javascript to code a "rock, paper, scissors" game.

 We will be using three functions :

 1.A function called "computerPlay()" which randomly selects an option between the three "rock, paper, scissors" which will be the computer's choice.

2.A function called "playRound()" which will run one round of the game and return the result of the round whilst keeping track of the score.

3.A function called "game()" which will run 5 rounds of the game and compare the scores to then return the winner of the 5 round game.
